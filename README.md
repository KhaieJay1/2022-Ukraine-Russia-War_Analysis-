# The Cost of War: Russia-Ukraine 2022 Casualties & Equipment Losses – Analysis as of Feb 15, 2025
### This analysis provides a data-driven analysis of Russian losses in the Russia-Ukraine war, tracking troop casualties, equipment destruction, and military impact. By visualizing key metrics such as personnel losses, aircraft, vehicles, naval units, and missile systems, the goal is to uncover trends, assess battlefield developments, and understand the broader implications of the conflict.
# Tools used
#### • Visual Studio Code – Writing and running Python scripts
#### • Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – Data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization
#### • GoogleSheets  – Storing and managing datasets
#### • Tableau  – Creating interactive dashboards for insights

# Skills used
#### • Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
#### • Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
#### • Time-Series & Geospatial Analysis
#### • Data Visualization & Dashboarding

# Process used
### 1. Data Collection & Cleaning:
#### • Extracted and preprocess military loss data from Kaggle (e.g., troop casualties, equipment destruction, vehicle losses).
#### • Gathered economic indicators such as inflation rates, energy prices, trade balance, and GDP decline using public financial datasets.
#### • Aggregated sanctions data from sources like OFAC, Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Reuters monitoring tools.
### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
#### • Used time-series analysis to track trends in military losses over time.
#### • Identified correlations between sanctions and economic downturn in Russia and Ukraine.
#### • Used geospatial analysis (e.g., DeepStateMap) to visualize military hotspots and destruction patterns.
### 3. Visualization & Reporting:
#### • Trend analysis using Matplotlib & Seaborn to plot troop & equipment losses over time.
#### • Tableau dashboards to track economic impact metrics & military damage.

# Result
#### • Russia has sustained heavy personnel and equipment losses, with over 854,320 casualties and thousands of tanks, aircraft, and artillery destroyed.
#### • Missile and long-range attack systems have been significantly depleted, with over 3,044 cruise missiles lost.
#### • Geospatial analysis highlights concentrated losses in eastern Ukraine, near cities like Luhansk and Donetsk.

# Insights
#### • Tanks and field artillery remain the most heavily affected land equipment categories.
#### • Drone losses have surged, indicating their increasing role in modern warfare.
#### • Naval and air losses, though lower in volume, represent significant strategic setbacks.
